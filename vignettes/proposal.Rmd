R/[Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) is highly used in bioinformatics workflows, allowing users to quickly connect identifiers that are technology specific to gene/transcript/protein identifiers. However, mapping disease phenotypes is a relatively underserved area in the Bioconductor Annotation Framework. An R-based interface to the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) would not only increase use, but also enable better open science. 

We are suggesting to develop the `monarchr` based on the [Bioconductor annotation workflow](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/workflows/annotation-data/).

## Starting Steps: Using Swagger on the Biolink API

[Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/) is a code generation framework that is helpful in developing API clients for any API that fits the OpenAPI specification. API clients can be developed, tested and deployed in an automated fashion for a number of languages (including R, Python and Rust). 

Using Swagger Codegen will be the starting point for the `monarchr` package, as it generates stubs and auto-documentation in the R Package format. However, putting together the 

## Development of Monarch Use Cases

Swagger is just the starting point for `monarchr`.  

## Submission of `monarchr` as a Bioconductor annotation package

We are recommending that the package be part of [Bioconductor]() as it has the largest potential audience of users. 

[Submission Guidelines to Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/developers/package-guidelines/) are fairly strict. The data structures output should be current Bioconductor objects (such as `ExpressionSet` and `AnnotatedDataFrame`). Bioconductor also has strict instructions on [web query packages](https://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/web-query/) to ensure that the package continues to work. 

Packages must also pass their build tests
